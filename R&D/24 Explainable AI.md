Enhanced Alzheimer's Disease Prediction methods and Better Quality Neuroimages continue to be in demand for both patients and physicians. In 2022, ChemicalQDevice focused on the area of Quantum Machine Learning Neuroimaging (QMLN) to prospectively address these concerns. 

Newsletters and slide decks featuring Literature reviews were made available to local leaders in business, government, and academia. Virtual speaking engagements by Mr. Kawchak extended to Washington D.C., London, and Chicago. More recently, Fortune 100 Leaders in Industry have continued to express interest in the Startup. 

Several 2023-2026 preliminary timelines regarding Stage I, II, and III products for partnership considerations were presented in the attached deck (Slides 2-8/94) - Including a 1 hr [discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00iuOBAr_3A).
