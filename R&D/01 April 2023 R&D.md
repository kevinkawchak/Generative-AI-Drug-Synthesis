Hybrid quantum-classical computing will likely play a pivotal role in improving medical image analysis with both performance and efficiency. Emerging hardware with more quantum bits and less noise is expected to offer key benefits, according to several experts, Slide 12. Quantum computers occupy a smaller footprint and consume far less energy on a performance basis for certain hybrid workloads than when utilizing only cpus and/or gpus.
