[Qiskit or PennyLane PyTorch Ports](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/python-pytorch-quantum-ml-portsmodels-for-potential-medical-use) PDF + Discussion 9/7/23.

IBM Qiskit and Xanadu PennyLane have the ability to insert quantum algorithms between Torch layers in Python notebooks. Qiskit TorchConnector makes the NeuralNetwork class available as a PyTorch module. PennyLane QNode contains a quantum circuit which is converted to a torch.nn layer. Medical data can then be analyzed with the hybrid models in ways familiar to deep learning [programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I5r_8R_3c8).
